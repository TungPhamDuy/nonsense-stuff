# nonsense-stuff
hello, this is some of the nonsense stuff that I encounter along the way.

"*way to where?*" - you may ask \
"*that is a good question!*" - I answer \
after a few pondering second, I reply \
"*i honestly dont know, but the only thing i do know is that, i getting closer to 'there' day by day*" \
"*but doesn't that a little bit counterintuitive of your belief? that you said, the meaning is not about the destination, but of the journey itself*" - said you, rather confused. \
"*yes, i do believe that. and i know with every passing day, as i keep trying to seek for a purpose in this little life of mine, i would eventually realize that, i will never be able to find it.*" \
"*then why are you doing this then?*" you ask, growing a bit frustrated. \
"*because, the meaning lie on the journey and struggle that come with it. there are no destination.*"
