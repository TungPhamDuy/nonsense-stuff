# nonsense-stuff
hello, this is some of the nonsense stuff that I encounter along the way. n\

"way to where?" - you may asked \
"that is a good question!" - I answer \
after a few pondering second, I reply \
"i honestly dont know, but the only thing i know is that, i getting closer to 'there' day by day"
"but doesn't that a little bit counter intuitive of your believe? that you said, the meaning is not about the destination, but of the journey itself" - said you, rather confused. \
"yes, i do believe that. and i know with everyday pass by, when i still trying to seek for a purpose in this little life of mine, i would eventually realize that, i will never be able to find it." \
"then why are you doing this then?" said you, frustrating a bit. \
"because, the meaning lie on the journey and struggle that come with it, and there are no destination"
